The 1988 Peugeot 205 Rallye 1.3 Group A/N was a game-changer in the automotive world, emerging as a beacon of performance and affordability. Initially unveiled amidst the roaring success of the Peugeot 205 GTI 1.6 and 1.9, this model bridged the gap between high-performance GTIs and standard models. Unlike its GTI counterparts, the Rallye boasted a more economical stance, positioned just below the 1.6 version with 115 horsepower.

This particular example, with a mileage of 104,000, hails from a private collection, showcasing superb condition and offering an exhilarating driving experience, especially when pushing its limits. From its inception, the 1988 Peugeot 205 Rallye 1.3 Group A/N has cemented its legacy as a potent combination of performance, affordability, and driving pleasure.
