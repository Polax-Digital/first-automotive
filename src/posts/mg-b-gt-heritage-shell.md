#### MG B GT 1975

First Automotive are delighted to present this stunning matching numbers 1975 MG B GT. With an incredibly low mileage of only 12,700 miles since its manufacture in 1975, this represents a rare investment opportunity for enthusiasts and collectors alike. Powered by an inline-four cylinder engine with an impressive 95 horsepower, offers a thrilling driving experience coupled with remarkable fuel efficiency.

In 1986, the vehicle was carefully parked and stored away, remaining untouched by the roads for an additional 19 years. In 2005, a meticulous full heritage shell restoration was undertaken, leaving no expense spared. As a result, this MG boasts its original chrome bumpers and retains its right-hand drive configuration. Since the restoration, it has only covered a mere 4,000 miles, showcasing both its impeccable condition and the outstanding craftsmanship of its restoration.

Included with this exceptional vehicle is a comprehensive service file along with a trove of original paperwork, offering a glimpse into its well-preserved history. Finished in the timeless British Racing Green, this MG B GT stands as a testament to iconic design and enduring style.
