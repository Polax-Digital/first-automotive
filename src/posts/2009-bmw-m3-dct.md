First Automotive are pleased to present this wonderful BMW (E92) M3 DCT finished in Jerez Black, this vehicle has 106,000 miles along with a full service history. This car boasts a full engine rebuild at 105,300 miles along with a DCT gearbox service in January 2022. The vehicle has since been sat in a collection amongst similar vehicles where the previous owner did not have time to complete the run in stage on the engine which is a recommended 1500 miles meaning there is a 1200 run in period required on this vehicle ensuring optimal performance and engine longevity. The interior was also retried at the same time to a bespoke black leather/ Alcantara combination. Since 2019 this vehicle has been garage kept.
